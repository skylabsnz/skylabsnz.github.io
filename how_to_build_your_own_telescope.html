				<h4>How To Build Your Own Telescope</h4>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>The following instructions allow to democratice the access to the science by giving the opportunity to build a reasonable size telescope and easy to use.</p>

				<p>Telescopes available in the market are usually quite expensive or low quality.</p>
				<p>In order to get a decent quality of image an aperture of 150mm is required.</p>
				<p>In order to get be able to visualize Deep Sky Objects, an aperture of 200mm is required.</p>
				<p>Telescopes of this size are not often easy to move, and it becames a challenge in airlines.</p>
				<p>The instructions provided allow to build an ultra compact dobsonian telescope.</p>
				<p>The weigth of the telescope is almost the same weight of the main mirror.</p>
				<p>All the components requiered are easy to find or can be ordered online.</p>
				<p>If you have skills and tools to work with the plywood, the cost of the telescope will be even cheaper.</p>

				<h4>License</h4>
				In order to insure safety, protect equipment and to enhance everyone enjoyment, we ask that you follow the Code of Conduct:
				<ul>
					<li>Pets are not permitted nearby the telescopes.</li>
					<li>Smoking and alcoholic beverages are never permitted within the area.</li>
					<li>Minors under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian at all times.</li>
					<li>Aerosol bug spray repellent may only be applied away from the telescopes. (Sprays produce a fine mist which can settle on optical surfaces and is very difficult to clean.)</li>
					<li>Remove any trash and keep the premises clean.</li>
					<li>Visitors should bring a flashlight with RED light to use for the walk from the parking lot to the observation area and for reading star maps.</li>
				</ul>
