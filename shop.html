							A planisphere is a simple hand-held device which shows a map of which stars are visible in the night sky at any particular time. By rotating a wheel, it shows how stars move across the sky through the night, and how different constellations are visible at different times of year. Using the materials available on this <a href="https://in-the-sky.org/planisphere/index.php" target="_blank">webpage</a>, you can make your own planisphere out of paper or cardboard. Developed by Dominic Ford.
