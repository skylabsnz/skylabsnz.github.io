title: Telescope Lab

			<section>
				<h4>Telescope Lab</h4>
				<p>We start before the sunset in order to explain very basic concepts about astronomy, telescopes, and photography. After that, you will have opportunities to observe the craters and mountains on the Moon, Jupiterâ€™s Great Red Spot and the rings of Saturn. <br/>
					You will also have a chance to observe deep sky objects like star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies.</p>

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span> The sessions will target different objects and topics every day. Since these events are weather dependant, on occasions we may need to cancel the event at short notice. If this happens, you will receive an email (prior to 7pm) notifying you of cancellation and a full refund will be given. </p>

				<p>Even though the sessions end late, these activities are family friendly and ideal for kids. You will have a nice opportunity to learn more about the solar system and the Universe, and also to motivate interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) in young minds. Some telescopes and additional resources will be available for use. Including telescopes that can be operated by kids.</p>

				<p>We will help you to identify bright stars and major constellations. During each observing session, we will teach participants to find those elusive patterns in the sky with a simple monthly star map and a green laser pointer that projects a visible beam into the sky. Just like at a planetarium but under the real night sky!</p>
